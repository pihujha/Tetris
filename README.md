#Introduction
  This is a simple implementation of the classic Tetris game using Python and the Pygame library. Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle game where you control the falling blocks, called Tetriminos, to create complete rows of blocks without any gaps. Once a row is complete, it is removed from the screen, and the player earns points.

#Requirements
Python 3.x
Pygame library

#Instructions
Install Python 3.x if you haven't already.
Install the Pygame library using pip:
Copy code
pip install pygame
Download or clone the repository.
Run the tetris.py file to start the game.

#Controls
Left Arrow Key: Move the Tetrimino left.
Right Arrow Key: Move the Tetrimino right.
Up Arrow Key: Rotate the Tetrimino.
Down Arrow Key: Move the Tetrimino down faster.
Spacebar: Instantly drop the Tetrimino to the bottom.

#Scoring
Each completed row earns you points.
The more rows you complete simultaneously, the more points you earn.
The game speed increases as your score increases.

#Features
Randomly generated Tetriminos.
Simple graphics using Pygame.
Score tracking.
Acknowledgments
This game is inspired by the classic Tetris game developed by Alexey Pajitnov. It's a fun and challenging puzzle game that has stood the test of time. Special thanks to the Pygame community for providing a simple and effective way to create games in Python.

#Future Improvements
Implement a high score system.
Add sound effects and music.
Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction.
Implement different game modes (e.g., endless mode, time trial mode).
